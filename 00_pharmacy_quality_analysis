#In this project, I used SQL queries to explore a pharmacy dataset and uncover how safety and pricing alignment drive better regulatory
results in order to help pharmaceutical teams prioritize safer, more cost-effective drug formulations, reducing regulatory delays and
maximizing ROl.

#What's the average price by approval status?
SELECT AVG(price_usd) AS avg_price, approval_status
FROM drug_data
GROUP BY approval_status;

Insights : Approved drugs have the highest average price ($257.56), followed closely by pending drugs ($256.12), while rejected drugs 
average significantly lower ($241.89). The small gap between approved and pending prices suggests that cost alone is not the 
determining factor in approval decisions. However, the clear drop in price among rejected drugs indicates that lower-priced submissions
may reflect lower investment or incomplete documentation, which can reduce approval chances.

Business Impact: Pharmaceutical teams can use this insight to find a balanced pricing strategy, one that reflects product quality 
without overpricing, ultimately improving approval odds while maintaining profitability.


#Which decade achieved the highest drug approval success rate?
SELECT (approval_year / 10) * 10 AS decade,
COUNT(*) AS total_drugs,
SUM(CASE WHEN LOWER(approval_status) = 'approved' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS approved_drugs,
ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN LOWER(approval_status) = 'approved' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*),2) AS approval_rate
FROM drug_data
WHERE approval_year IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY decade
ORDER BY decade desc;

Insights: Over the past three decades, approval rates have remained relatively stable. The 2010s showed the strongest performance
at 34.15%, which could point to better data standards or more efficient review processes. But I also noticed a dip in the 2020s down 
to 31.28%, likely reflecting stricter regulations or post-pandemic slowdowns. 

Business Impact: This insight can help pharmaceutical companies evaluate long-term regulatory performance, forecast approval 
probabilities and adapt research strategies to meet evolving compliance expectations so investing in data-driven trial optimization, 
and enhancing safety documentation can help recapture the higher success rates of the past decade which will lead to faster approval.

#Which side effect categories are linked to higher or lower drug approval rates?
SELECT side_effects,
COUNT(*) AS total_drugs,
ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN LOWER(approval_status) = 'approved' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) AS approval_rate,
CASE WHEN side_effect_severity='Mild' THEN 'Low Risk'
WHEN side_effect_severity='Moderate' THEN 'Medium Risk'
WHEN side_effect_severity='Severe' THEN 'High Risk'
ELSE 'Unknown'
END AS side_effect_category
FROM drug_data
GROUP BY side_effect_category
ORDER BY approval_rate DESC;

Insights: Low risk drugs had the highest approval rate at 35.7%, while those labeled Medium to high risk dropped to around 30%. 
This pattern shows that side effects severity plays a major role in how regulatory bodies evaluate drug safety and market readiness.

Business Impact: Pharmaceutical teams should prioritize investment in compounds with lower side-effect severity, even if it increases 
initial testing costs. Reducing risk profiles during clinical trials could raise approval probability by up to 5%, translating to 
faster product launches and stronger long-term profitability. Additionally, marketing and pricing strategies should emphasize safety 
to build patient and physician trust.

#What is the average lifespan of approved drugs before expiration?
SELECT ROUND(AVG(JULIANDAY(date(expiry_date))
- JULIANDAY(date(approval_year || '-01-01'))
)) AS avg_days_diff,
ROUND(AVG((JULIANDAY(date(expiry_date)) 
- JULIANDAY(date(approval_year || '-01-01'))) / 365.25), 2) AS avg_years_diff
FROM drug_data
WHERE expiry_date IS NOT NULL 
AND approval_year IS NOT NULL;

Insights: On average, drugs remain active in the market for 20.25 years between their approval and expiry dates. This long lifespan
highlights a stable return window for manufacturers but it also signals potential gaps in innovation turnover and patent renewal
strategy.

Business Impact: This insight should be used to to strategically plan R&D pipelines around the 20-year mark. As patents approach
expiration, firms can prepare next-generation formulations or generic alternatives to maintain market share. Additionally, 
monitoring drugs with shorter lifespans can help identify early signs of declining safety performance or competitive pressure, 
enabling proactive portfolio management.

#Does drug dosage level influence approval outcomes?
SELECT dosage_stage,approval_status,COUNT(*) AS total_drug,ROUND(COUNT(*)*100.0/SUM(COUNT(*))OVER (PARTITION BY dosage_stage),2) AS perc_in_stage
FROM(
SELECT CASE WHEN CAST (dosage_mg AS INT) >850 THEN 'high_dosage'
ELSE 'normal_dosage' END AS dosage_stage,
CAST(dosage_mg AS INT),drug_name, approval_status
FROM drug_data)
GROUP BY dosage_stage,approval_status;

Insights: The analysis shows that normal-dosage drugs make up the majority of submissions, with an average approval rate of 31.75%,
while high-dosage drugs see a slightly higher success rate of 34.58%. This suggests that although higher doses may appear more 
effective during trials, they also come with increased regulatory scrutiny and potential safety concerns that can impact overall
approval outcomes.

Business Impact: Pharmaceutical companies should aim to find the optimal dosage balance that demonstrates efficacy without triggering
safety red flags. Before submission, high-dosage drugs should undergo additional safety testing and documentation to strengthen
approval confidence. Focusing on moderate dosage formulations can help accelerate approval timelines, lower regulatory risk 
and optimize R&D spending efficiency.

#What is the earliest and latest approval year and how many drugs were approved per year?
SELECT MIN (approval_year) AS ealiest_approval, 
MAX(approval_year) AS latest_approval,
COUNT(*) AS count_of_drug,
ROW_NUMBER()OVER(ORDER BY COUNT(*)DESC)AS rank_position
FROM drug_data
GROUP BY approval_year;

Insights: The data shows that 2006 led with 57 approved drugs, closely followed by 2017 with 56 approvals.Other high-performing years
such as 2004, 1997 and 1990 also reflect steady approval momentum. These standout years likely reflect periods of strong innovation 
or more efficient regulatory processes. It suggests that approval activity tends to rise in waves, often linked to new research 
breakthroughs or industry-wide shifts in focus.


Business Impact : Pharmaceutical teams can use this trend to understand what made certain years like 2006 and 2017 so successful,
whether it was faster review timelines, stronger clinical evidence or innovation in key drug classes. Learning from those patterns 
can help companies plan smarter R&D strategies, focus resources on high-success areas and ultimately increase their chances of faster
drug approvals in the future. 

#Which drug administration routes are most commonly used?
SELECT administration_route,
COUNT(*) AS count_of_drug,
ROW_NUMBER()OVER(ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS rank_position
FROM drug_data
WHERE administration_route IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY administration_route;
