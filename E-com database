This project explores customer purchasing behavior to uncover business insights that can drive smarter decisions

#Which membership type delivers the best ROI (spend per item)?

SELECT Membership_Type,
ROUND(SUM(Total_Spend)*1.0/SUM(Items_Purchased),2.0) AS spend_per_item
FROM ecom
GROUP BY Membership_Type
ORDER BY spend_per_item DESC;

Business Insight: Gold members deliver the highest ROI per purchase even with fewer customers so leadership should prioritize 
retention campaigns for Gold members and upsell strategies for Silver customers who are close behind

#Which factors predicts satisfaction the best?

SELECT Satisfaction_Level,
AVG (Total_Spend) AS AVG_Spend,
AVG(Items_Purchased) AS AVG_Purchased,
AVG(Average_Rating)AS AVG_Rating,
AVG(Days_Since_Last_Purchase)AS AVG_Days_Gap
FROM ecom
GROUP BY Satisfaction_Level;

Business Insight: Satisfied customers spend more, purchase more often and leave higher ratings so keeping them satisfied should be a 
top priority and for those who aren't as satisfied, a quicm follow-up, better support or a personalized offer could turn them around 
and boost revenue 

# Finding the customers who aren't satisfied but spend more

SELECT Customer_ID, Membership_Type,Total_Spend,Satisfaction_Level
FROM ecom 
WHERE Satisfaction_Level='Unsatisfied'
AND Total_Spend > (SELECT AVG(Total_Spend) AS Avg_Spend 
FROM ecom)
ORDER BY Total_Spend DESC;

Business Insight: Some of the biggest spenders are unsatisfied so losing these customers would hurt revenue so treat them like VIPs: 
reacg out personally, offer tailored perks and show them they're valued.

#Customers with Gold membership

SELECT Customer_ID, Membership_Type
FROM ecom
WHERE Membership_Type = 'Gold';


#How many members each membership has?

SELECT COUNT (Membership_type)
FROM ecom
GROUP BY Membership_type;

Business Insight: Mmebership distribution is almost evenly split so prioritize strategies to retain Gold members with exclusive perks
and priority service, to encourage Silver members upgrades to Gold with clear added value and keep Bronze members engage with small
wins(discounts,loyalty points)
